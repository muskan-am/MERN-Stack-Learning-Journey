           <p>Web development is the art and science of building and maintaining websites. It's broadly split into three parts</p>

            <p>Front-End Development: This is everything a user sees and interacts with. It's built using languages like **HTML** for structure, **CSS** for design, and **JavaScript** for interactivity. Think of it as the website's face.</p>
            <p>Back-End Development: This is the server-side of a websiteâ€”the part users don't see. It handles things like databases and user accounts, using languages such as **Python, Java, or PHP**. It's the brain of the operation.</p>
            <p>Full-Stack Development: A developer with this skill set can work on both the front-end and back-end, handling all aspects of a website from start to finish.</p>

            <p>The field is always changing, with new tools and frameworks like **React** and **Django** making it easier and faster to create complex, dynamic websites. Whether you're a designer, a coder, or both, web development offers a creative and in-demand career path.</p>
