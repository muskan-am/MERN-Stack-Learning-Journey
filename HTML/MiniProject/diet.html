    <p>Achieving your fitness goals is a two-part equation: consistent exercise and smart nutrition. What you eat
        provides the energy for your workouts, the building blocks for muscle repair, and the essential nutrients for
        overall health. Here is a detailed guide to help you build a sustainable and effective diet plan.</p>

            <h3>Macronutrients: Your Plate's Foundation</h3>Macronutrients are the three main components of food that
            your body needs in large quantities: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. A balanced diet includes all three.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Protein: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Function: </b>Crucial for muscle repair and growth, hormone production, and enzyme
                            function. It's the building block of your body.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sources: </b> Lean meats (chicken, turkey), fish (salmon, tuna), eggs, dairy (Greek
                            yogurt, cottage cheese), legumes (lentils, chickpeas), and plant-based proteins (tofu,
                            tempeh).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Recommendation: </b>Aim to include a source of protein in every meal to support muscle
                            recovery, especially after a workout.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Carbohydrates: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Function: </b>Your body's primary source of energy. They fuel your workouts and daily
                            activities.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sources (Complex Carbs): </b>Whole grains (oats, brown rice, quinoa), sweet potatoes,
                            vegetables, and fruits. These provide sustained energy and fiber.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sources (Simple Carbs): </b>Sugary drinks, white bread, and pastries. These should be
                            limited as they provide a quick burst of energy followed by a crash.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Recommendation: </b> Focus on complex carbohydrates for long-lasting energy. A
                            pre-workout meal with carbs can significantly improve your performance.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Healthy Fats: </h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Function: </b>Essential for hormone production, nutrient absorption, and joint health.
                            They also provide a source of energy.</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Sources: </b>Avocado, nuts (almonds, walnuts), seeds (chia seeds, flax seeds), and
                            healthy oils (olive oil).</li>
                        <br>
                        <li><b>Recommendation: </b>Incorporate healthy fats in moderation. They are calorie-dense, so a
                            little goes a long way.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3> Meal Timing and Hydration</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Pre-Workout Meal (1-2 hours before): </b>A combination of easily digestible carbohydrates and a
                    small amount of protein. This provides the energy you need to perform.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: A banana with a tablespoon of peanut butter, or a small bowl of oatmeal.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Post-Workout Meal (within 1-2 hours after): </b>This is your window for muscle recovery. A meal
                    rich in protein and carbohydrates helps replenish glycogen stores and repair muscle tissue.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Example: Grilled chicken with sweet potatoes, or a protein shake with a piece of fruit.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Hydration: </b>Water is vital for everything from regulating body temperature to transporting
                    nutrients.
                    <br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Recommendation: </b> Drink water consistently throughout the day, not just when you're
                            thirsty. A
                            good rule of thumb is to aim for 2-3 liters per day, and more on days you exercise.</li>
                    </ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Listen to Your Body and Be Consistent</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Portion Control: </b>Pay attention to portion sizes. Instead of counting every calorie, use your hand as a guide: a fist-sized portion of carbs, a palm-sized portion of protein, etc.

               </li>
               <br>
                <li><b>Don't Cut Out Entire Food Groups: </b>A healthy diet is about balance and moderation, not deprivation. Cutting out carbs or fats completely can be detrimental to your health and energy levels.</li>
                <br>
                <li><b>Consult a Professional: </b> For a truly personalized plan, consider consulting a registered dietitian or nutritionist. They can help you create a diet that is tailored to your specific needs, health conditions, and fitness goals.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <p>Remember, consistency is more important than perfection. Small, sustainable changes over time will lead to the best results.</p>
